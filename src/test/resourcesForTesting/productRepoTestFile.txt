Now for the price of one, you get two great antennas to enjoy your favorite TV shows for free.  First there is the popular Mohu® Leaf Ultimate. This paper-thin HDTV antenna is the amplified version that reaches out in a 50-mile radius from your home to bring you the most popular broadcast TV shows, news and sports, on both network and local television in full 1080 HD – for FREE. No need for cable or satellite fees to watch stations like PBS, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox, with each network having its own digital sub-channels for maximum content. The Leaf Ultimate is derived from advanced U.S. military technology and is combined with Mohu’s CleanPeak™ filter technology to eliminate unwanted cellular or FM signals.  Next is the brand new Mohu® Leaf Metro. Bulky and industrial is out; compact and stylish is in. With this latest version, Mohu engineers have redefined the image and style of antennas, just like they did when they invented the very first paper-thin HDTV antenna a few short years ago. Able to reach broadcast towers in a 25-mile radius from your home, this trendy new addition to the company’s popular Leaf antenna family delivers top performance in a stylish, small package. Its reversible black-and-white “bowtie” design dresses up any TV set, whether it’s perched up high, hanging out by the window or adorning a wall. The Metro is also ideal for tailgating parties, in your RV, in dorm rooms or simply taking it on the road.",

        "longDescription": "Lightning and Surge Protection SurgeArrest components such as MOVs and Thermal fuse ensure instantaneous reaction to lightning strikes and wiring faults. If the surge components are damaged due to power spike or over voltage, excess power cannot reach your equipment. Unlike the APC SurgeArrest products, most surge suppressors continue to let power through even after circuits have been damaged, leaving your equipment exposed to other damaging surges. IEEE Let-Through Rating and UL 1449 Compliance The 'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) Let-Through Voltage rating is based on a test that subjects a Surge Protector to a 6,000 volt spike. The rating equates to the amount of excess voltage that reaches connected equipment. The lower the number, the better the performance of the Surge Protector is. Underwriter's Laboratory's UL1449 surge protection safety standard uses these ratings to help users gauge performance. UL's best Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor (TVSS) Let-Through Voltage rating is \"300V\". Data-line Protection Protection of data lines (Ethernet, Coaxial and Phone lines) ensures complete protection of your equipment from surges. It is very important to protect your equipment from back door surges traveling through data lines, as they can be as damaging to your equipment as surges traveling over power lines. Noise Filtering Surge Protector attenuates EMI/RFI line noise that can cause data errors and keyboard lockups, ensuring better performance of protected equipment.",
